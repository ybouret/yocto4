/* Any one of KISS, MWC, FIB, LFIB4, SWB, SHR3, or CONG 
 can be used in an expression to provide a random 32-bit 
 integer. 
 The KISS generator, (Keep It Simple Stupid), is 
 designed to combine the two multiply-with-carry 
 generators in MWC with the 3-shift register SHR3 and 
 the congruential generator CONG, using addition and 
 exclusive-or. Period about 2^123. 
 It is one of my favorite generators. 
 The  MWC generator concatenates two 16-bit multiply- 
 with-carry generators, x(n)=36969x(n-1)+carry, 
 y(n)=18000y(n-1)+carry  mod 2^16, has period about 
 2^60 and seems to pass all tests of randomness. A 
 favorite stand-alone generator---faster than KISS, 
 which contains it. 
 FIB is the classical Fibonacci sequence 
 x(n)=x(n-1)+x(n-2),but taken modulo 2^32. 
 Its period is 3*2^31 if one of its two seeds is odd 
 and not 1 mod 8. It has little worth as a RNG by 
 itself, but provides a simple and fast component for 
 use in combination generators. 
 SHR3 is a 3-shift-register generator with period 
 2^32-1. It uses y(n)=y(n-1)(I+L^17)(I+R^13)(I+L^5), 
 with the y's viewed as binary vectors, L the 32x32 
 binary matrix that shifts a vector left 1, and R its 
 transpose.  SHR3 seems to pass all except those 
 related to the binary rank test, since 32 successive 
 values, as binary vectors, must be linearly 
 independent, while 32 successive truly random 32-bit 
 integers, viewed as binary vectors, will be linearly 
 independent only about 29% of the time. 
 CONG is a congruential generator with the widely used 69069 
 multiplier: x(n)=69069x(n-1)+1234567.  It has period 
 2^32. The leading half of its 32 bits seem to pass 
 tests, but bits in the last half are too regular. 
 LFIB4 is an extension of what I have previously 
 defined as a lagged Fibonacci generator: 
 x(n)=x(n-r) op x(n-s), with the x's in a finite 
 set over which there is a binary operation op, such 
 as +,- on integers mod 2^32, * on odd such integers, 
 exclusive-or(xor) on binary vectors. Except for 
 those using multiplication, lagged Fibonacci 
 generators fail various tests of randomness, unless 
 the lags are very long. (See SWB below). 
 To see if more than two lags would serve to overcome 
 the problems of 2-lag generators using +,- or xor, I 
 have developed the 4-lag generator LFIB4 using 
 addition: x(n)=x(n-256)+x(n-179)+x(n-119)+x(n-55) 
 mod 2^32. Its period is 2^31*(2^256-1), about 2^287, 
 and it seems to pass all tests---in particular, 
 those of the kind for which 2-lag generators using 
 +,-,xor seem to fail.  For even more confidence in 
 its suitability,  LFIB4 can be combined with KISS, 
 with a resulting period of about 2^410: just use 
 (KISS+LFIB4) in any C expression. 
 SWB is a subtract-with-borrow generator that I 
 developed to give a simple method for producing 
 extremely long periods: 
 x(n)=x(n-222)-x(n-237)- borrow mod 2^32. 
 The 'borrow' is 0, or set to 1 if computing x(n-1) 
 caused overflow in 32-bit integer arithmetic. This 
 generator has a very long period, 2^7098(2^480-1), 
 about 2^7578.   It seems to pass all tests of 
 randomness, except for the Birthday Spacings test, 
 which it fails badly, as do all lagged Fibonacci 
 generators using +,- or xor. I would suggest 
 combining SWB */
